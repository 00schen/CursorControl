Light Switch,,,,,,,
After Phase 1 - Light Switch,,,,,,,
The system performed the task I wanted,,,x,,,,
I felt in control,,x,,,,,
The system responded to my input in the way that I expected,x,,,,,,
"The system was competent at performing tasks, even if they weren't the tasks I wanted",,,,,,x,
The system improved over time,x,,,,,,
I improved at using the system over time,,,,x,,,
"I always looked directly at my final target, holding the same gaze throughout an episode",,x,,,,,
"I compensated for flaws in the system by changing my gaze over time (e.g., by exaggerating looking in certain directions)",,,,,,,x
Please describe your input strategy,"When the robot is close to the goal, gaze at some middle point between robot and goal; when robot is faraway from goal, gaze at some point that goes beyond the goal in the goal direction.",,,,,,
Any other feedback?,The robot does not seem to be adapting the actions to my changing gaze (at least not much).,,,,,,

"I always looked directly at my final target, holding the same gaze throughout an episode",x,,,,,,
"I compensated for flaws in the system by changing my gaze over time (e.g., by exaggerating looking in certain directions)",,,,,,,x
Please describe your input strategy,"Almost always look to the right of the goal; the farther the goal is, the farther the gaze will be from the goal as well.",,,,,,
Any other feedback?,"I need to admit that I am a bit biased by the name ""no right"" and I might not find the (correct?) pattern that quickly without that hint.",,,,,,

"I always looked directly at my final target, holding the same gaze throughout an episode",x,,,,,,
"I compensated for flaws in the system by changing my gaze over time (e.g., by exaggerating looking in certain directions)",,,,,,,x
Please describe your input strategy,Look at a point slightly beyond the goal in the goal direction and adjust the gaze location according to robot behavior.,,,,,,
Any other feedback?,"Sometimes the robot responds very well to my gazes (better than phase 2), but at some other times it just does not seem to be aware of that at all (similar to phase 1). Also I need to admit that I got tired over time and might not have provided as accurate input as in the previous phases.",,,,,,

"I always looked directly at my final target, holding the same gaze throughout an episode",,,,,x,,
"I compensated for flaws in the system by changing my gaze over time (e.g., by exaggerating looking in certain directions)",,,,,,x,
Please describe your input strategy,"Look at a point beyond the goal in the goal direction, as far as possible, and holding the same gaze; it seems to be working most of the time unless the bottles are far away from the middle.",,,,,,

Any other feedback?,"It is very weird that no matter how far left I tried to look at, the robot almost never succeeded when the target bottle is on the left.",,,,,,
