5_30_0: decoder is updated every rl update, but the prediction weight is only updated every episode
6_1_0: checkpoint decoder, uses feeding environment
6_2_0: curriculum learning, but was not updating curriculum
6_3_0: still didn't update curriculum :L
6_4_0: infinite success buffer
6_4_1: starting radius of .3
6_4_2: starting radius of .4
6_4_3: Pretrain data has dropout
6_7_0: oracle produces noised target
6_7_1: curriculum directly measures prediction distance
6_7_2: directly measure distance and oracle produces noised target
6_8_0: same as 6_7_0 but prediction lstm looks at output, not cell layer
6_8_1: same as 6_7_2 ^^^
6_8_2: SAC on vanilla FeedingJaco
6_8_3: SAC on FeedingJaco with noise added to goal information 
6_8_4: SAC on FeedingJaco with noise added to goal information but uses lstm to decode

laptop_6_1_0: Using SAC from sb3 implementation, did not succeed enough
laptop_6_3_0: Using PPO from rllib implementation, added parallelism, NaN errors?
